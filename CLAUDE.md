This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

HoloAssist is a ROS 2-based XR robotic sorting system. A UR3e collaborative arm with an OnRobot gripper sorts physical objects into bins within a workspace. An Intel RealSense depth camera detects and identifies objects as they enter the workspace, and the system operates in two modes:

- **Teleoperation mode** — a human operator wearing a Meta Quest 3 headset controls the robot arm and gripper in mixed reality to pick and sort objects.
- **Autonomous mode** — the robot autonomously sorts objects using MoveIt 2 trajectory planning without human input.

Real-world objects are mapped to different virtual objects in the XR scene (e.g., a physical tomato appears as a bomb that needs "defusing" into the correct bin), creating a gamified operator experience.

This branch (`nic`) is one of several personal branches in a shared research team repository (other branches: `john`, `ollie`, `seb`).

- ✅ RobotController.cs created with three control modes (Direct Joint + RMRC + Hand Guide) — rewritten to use Unity Input System (was OVRInput, which didn't work without OVRManager)
- ✅ RobotBasePlacer.cs working — controller grip-to-grab and drag robot in MR (on parent wrapper GameObject)
- ✅ JointStateSubscriber.cs rewritten to be purely kinematic (no ArticulationBody physics, direct Transform rotations)
- ✅ Joint axes fixed — extracts actual axis from ArticulationBody anchorRotation, composes with initial URDF rest rotation
- ✅ Joint limits added from URDF (elbow ±180°, others ±360°)
- ✅ Digital twin verified on Quest 3 — joints match real robot direction and axes
- ✅ RobotControlActions.inputactions created — dedicated Input System actions for robot control

- ✅ dashboard.sh created — sources ROS automatically before launching dashboard
- ✅ RMRC mode tested on Quest 3 with real robot — works, some lag but functional
- ✅ Full teleoperation loop with RMRC verified
- ✅ SpatialMarkers.cs created — RGB axes on tool0 + yellow velocity arrow (coordinate fix applied)
- ✅ RMRC Rotate sub-mode added — X button toggles Translate/Rotate, direct wrist joint control (joints 3/4/5)
- ✅ Hand Guide mode added — hold right grip to track controller position in 3D space, robot EE follows hand via Jacobian IK
- ✅ SessionLogger.cs created — tracks mode switches, per-mode durations, session time; publishes JSON to `/session/status` (2Hz) + `/session/events`; saves session log JSON on quit
- ✅ Dashboard STATS tab — session info bar + rolling joint velocity graph + topic health graph
- ✅ Dashboard LATENCY tab — live latency numbers + message age graph + command interval graph
- ✅ Dashboard SESSION tab — text overview of control mode, durations, connection status, topic rates
- ✅ Dashboard saves session log to `~/holoassist_sessions/` on shutdown
- ✅ OnRobot RG2 gripper URDF created — `ur3e_rg2.urdf` combines UR3e + RG2 gripper (attached to tool0), STL meshes in `Assets/URDF/onrobot_rg2/`
- ✅ RG2 URDF imported in Unity — replaced old `ur` GameObject with `ur3e_rg2`, visual STLs renamed to `*_visual.stl` to work around URDF-Importer name-collision bug (collision/visual share filenames → `UsedTemplateFiles` skip)
- ✅ New robot verified working — all 6 arm joints mirror correctly, velocity arrow enlarged (0.25m length, 0.008m thick) to clear gripper geometry
- ✅ Gripper control from XR — right index trigger (analog 0–100%) maps to gripper width, publishes Float64MultiArray (metres) to `/finger_width_controller/commands` via `ur_onrobot` driver. Digital twin animates all 6 gripper joints (finger_joint + 5 mimic joints) from `finger_width` in `/joint_states`. Default grip force lowered to 5N (was 20N) in `onrobot_driver/src/RG.cpp`. Hardware interface only sends Modbus commands when width changes (0.5mm threshold), and re-syncs command to current width on activation to prevent snap-close.
- ✅ **Switched to `UR_OnRobot_ROS2` driver** (by Tony Le) — replaces separate UR driver + custom `gripper_node.py`. Combined launch (`ur_onrobot_control start_robot.launch.py`) handles UR3e + RG2 gripper natively via C++ Modbus (no more socat/pymodbus hack). Old `gripper_node.py` is now obsolete.
- ✅ **Collision protection rewritten (mesh-based)** — `MeshCollisionGuard.cs` replaces old point-based system. Auto-discovers all MeshColliders in robot hierarchy, sets them convex for `ClosestPoint` queries. Two collision layers: (1) **Table** — checks each collider's bounding box min Y against table height; (2) **Self-collision** — proximal links (base/shoulder/upper_arm) vs distal links (wrist_1 through gripper) using `ClosestPoint` distance. Both use soft-zone gradual slowdown + hard stop. Gizmo drawing in Scene view (table planes, collider bounds colour-coded by zone). Attach to `ur3e_rg2`, assign `robotBase` to itself, drag into `RobotController.collisionGuard` field.
- ✅ EE lock-down mode — Y button toggles; uses combined 6x6 Jacobian solve (`ResolveFullVelocity`) so linear + angular goals are resolved simultaneously (no jitter from competing solves). Works immediately without grip. 1° dead zone, gain 0.5, max 0.3 rad/s (slow gentle transition). Works in RMRC Translate + Hand Guide modes. HUD shows "LOCK ▼" when active.
- ✅ Output velocity smoothing (60ms exponential low-pass) on all joint velocities before publishing. Resets on mode switch.
- ✅ Dashboard shows gripper status (bar + percentage) on STATUS tab
- ✅ RobotHUD shows gripper bar + EE lock indicator in all modes
- ⚠️ **Performance/lag** — noticeable lag during teleoperation, even on fake hardware (not just Quest 3 WiFi). Gripper lag is partly the ROS round-trip (Unity → ros_tcp_endpoint → controller → `/joint_states` → Unity). Possible fixes: (1) add local gripper preview in `JointStateSubscriber` using `RobotController.GripperValue` for instant visual while still publishing to ROS; (2) reduce GC pressure — pre-allocate arrays in UR3eKinematics; (3) check if ros_tcp_endpoint is the bottleneck.
- ⬜ **Tuning needed** — linear movement too fast, wrist rotation (RMRC Rotate sub-mode) too slow. Adjust `linearSpeed` (currently 0.25 m/s — reduce) and `jointJogSpeed` (currently 0.5 rad/s — increase for wrist joints in Rotate mode).
- ⬜ **Collision protection calibration** — `MeshCollisionGuard` implemented, needs `tableWorldY` or `tableTransform` set to actual table height, and self-collision margins tuned on real hardware.
- ✅ WiFi reliability solved — laptop + Quest 3 both on robot's dedicated router (192.168.0.x subnet), no more university WiFi dropouts
- ✅ ROSAutoConnect.cs created — auto-discovers `ros_tcp_endpoint` by TCP-scanning `192.168.0.101`–`109` on port 10000 (skips `.100` Ethernet). No beacon/multicast needed — works reliably on Quest/Android. Falls back to Unity ROS Settings IP if nothing found.
- ✅ beacon.py updated — uses multicast group `239.255.42.99` + subnet broadcast fallback. launch.py auto-detects `192.168.0.x` WiFi IP via `netifaces`.
- ⚠️ **MeshCollisionGuard breaks arm control** — enabling the collision mesh component prevents all arm velocity commands (only gripper works). Keep disabled until calibrated.
- ⬜ **Scene needs re-setup after merge** — portal test chamber environment added back to scene temporarily but missing textures. ROSAutoConnect needs to be attached to a GameObject in hierarchy.

## Development Environment

**Prerequisites:** ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04, Unity 6.3 LTS.

**Do not use Docker** — workspace is built from source using `UR_OnRobot_ROS2` (combined UR + OnRobot driver). All dependencies already in `ros2_ws/src/`.

### Quick Start (launcher scripts)

```bash
# Fake hardware (default) — no real robot needed
./launch.sh

# Real robot
./launch.sh --robot-ip 192.168.0.194

# No RViz (lighter)
./launch.sh --no-rviz

# Dashboard (separate terminal)
./dashboard.sh --fullscreen

# Dashboard without ROS (UI testing only)
./dashboard.sh --no-ros --fullscreen
```

`launch.sh` and `dashboard.sh` source ROS automatically. `launch.py` accepts `--robot-ip`, `--ros-ip`, and `--no-rviz` flags. No `--robot-ip` = fake hardware mode.

### Build the ROS workspace

```bash
cd ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

### Launch Sequence (real robot at 192.168.0.194)

```bash
# Check laptop IPs first (Ethernet for robot, WiFi for Quest)
hostname -I

# Terminal 1 — UR + OnRobot combined driver
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && source ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch ur_onrobot_control start_robot.launch.py ur_type:=ur3e onrobot_type:=rg2 robot_ip:=192.168.0.194 launch_rviz:=true

# Terminal 2 — ROS-TCP bridge
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && source ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 run ros_tcp_endpoint default_server_endpoint --ros-args -p ROS_IP:=0.0.0.0

# Terminal 3 — switch to velocity + gripper controllers
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && source ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 control switch_controllers --activate forward_velocity_controller finger_width_controller --deactivate scaled_joint_trajectory_controller finger_width_trajectory_controller
```

Then on the teach pendant: load and run External Control program (Host IP: `192.168.0.100`).
Then hit Play in Unity.

**Note:** Both RMRC and Direct Joint modes publish to `/forward_velocity_controller/commands`. Gripper publishes to `/finger_width_controller/commands` (Float64MultiArray, position in metres). Both controllers must be active — check with `ros2 control list_controllers`. MoveIt Servo is no longer used for teleoperation. MoveIt 2 will be used by Oliver's autonomous sorting subsystem.

### Simulated Hardware (no real robot)

```bash
# Terminal 1 — fake UR3e + RG2 hardware
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && source ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch ur_onrobot_control start_robot.launch.py ur_type:=ur3e onrobot_type:=rg2 use_fake_hardware:=true launch_rviz:=true

# Terminal 2 — switch to velocity + gripper controllers (wait for Terminal 1 to finish loading)
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && source ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 control switch_controllers --activate forward_velocity_controller finger_width_controller --deactivate scaled_joint_trajectory_controller finger_width_trajectory_controller

# Terminal 3 — ROS-TCP bridge
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && source ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 run ros_tcp_endpoint default_server_endpoint --ros-args -p ROS_IP:=0.0.0.0
```

No teach pendant needed. Joint states and controllers work fine.

### Network Setup

Both laptop and Quest 3 connect to the UR3e's own router — all devices on the same `192.168.0.x` subnet.

```
Robot's Router (192.168.0.x):
  ├─ UR3e robot:  192.168.0.194
  ├─ Laptop WiFi: 192.168.0.102  ←──→ Quest 3
  └─ Laptop Ethernet: 192.168.0.100 ←──→ UR3e (direct)
```

- **Teach pendant External Control host IP**: `192.168.0.100` (laptop Ethernet)
- **Unity ROS Settings IP**: `192.168.0.102` (laptop WiFi on robot's router)
- **ros_tcp_endpoint**: `ROS_IP:=0.0.0.0` (listens on all interfaces)
- No more university WiFi issues — dedicated robot router provides stable, low-latency connection

## System Architecture

```
Intel RealSense (Depth Camera)
  └─ object detection, colour/CV classification, pose tracking
       ↓
ROS 2 Network
  ├─ Object poses broadcast (robot frame, via QR code calibration)
  ├─ ros_tcp_endpoint → Unity (XR overlays + teleop)
  └─ MoveIt 2 (autonomous trajectory planning — Oliver's subsystem)
       ↓
Two Operating Modes:
  ├─ TELEOP (Nic): Quest 3 controllers → RMRC/Hand Guide → velocity commands → UR3e + gripper
  └─ AUTONOMOUS (Oliver): MoveIt 2 → planned trajectories → UR3e + gripper
       ↓
UR3e + OnRobot Gripper
  └─ picks objects, places in bins
       ↓
Depth Camera verifies correct bin placement
```

**Teleoperation modes (Nic's subsystem):**
- **RMRC**: Jacobian-based Cartesian velocity control (translate + rotate sub-modes)
- **Direct Joint**: Individual joint jogging
- **Hand Guide**: Controller position tracking with Jacobian IK
- **Gripper**: Analog control via right index trigger (0–100%), publishes to `/finger_width_controller/commands` (metres, via `ur_onrobot` driver)
- **EE Lock-Down**: Y button toggle — locks tool pointing straight down via angular Jacobian correction
- **Collision Protection**: Table + self-collision prevention via predictive FK link position checks

## Unity Project

- **Path:** `Unity/My project/`
- **Version:** Unity 6.3 LTS (6000.3.9f1)
- **Build target:** Android (Meta Quest 3)
- **Scene:** `Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity`
- **ROS IP:** Set to laptop's WiFi IP for Quest builds (e.g., `172.19.115.245`), Port: 10000 (configured in Robotics → ROS Settings). Use `0.0.0.0` for ros_tcp_endpoint so it listens on all interfaces.

### OnRobot RG2 Gripper (URDF)

The combined `ur3e_rg2.urdf` adds the RG2 gripper to the UR3e, attached to `tool0` via a fixed joint. Gripper structure:

- `onrobot_rg2_base_link` — gripper body (fixed to tool0)
- `finger_joint` — **primary actuated joint** (revolute, left outer knuckle, limits: -0.558 to 0.785 rad)
- 5 mimic joints mirror `finger_joint`: `left_inner_knuckle_joint`, `left_inner_finger_joint`, `right_outer_knuckle_joint`, `right_inner_knuckle_joint`, `right_inner_finger_joint`
- Only `finger_joint` needs to be driven — all other gripper joints follow via mimic

Mesh source: [UOsaka-Harada-Laboratory/onrobot](https://github.com/UOsaka-Harada-Laboratory/onrobot) (`onrobot_rg_description`). Raw xacro files stored in `nic/urdf/`, meshes in `nic/meshes/rg2/`.

### Key Scripts

- `Assets/Scripts/JointStateSubscriber.cs` — attach to root `ur` GameObject; subscribes to `/joint_states` and sets joint rotations directly via `Transform.localRotation` (no ArticulationBody physics). Disables all ArticulationBody components on Start. Contains `rosToUnity` name mapping dictionary. Also animates gripper joints (finger_joint + 5 mimic joints) from `finger_width` in `/joint_states` (metres, from `ur_onrobot` driver) — maps width to finger_joint angle internally.
- `Assets/Scripts/RobotBasePlacer.cs` — attach to an **empty parent wrapper** (e.g. `RobotRig`) that contains `ur` (and optionally the trolley) as children. Uses XR controller grip button — hold grip near rig to grab and drag. Supports Y-axis rotation while grabbed (keeps robot upright). Pure transform movement, no physics.
- `Assets/Scripts/UR3eKinematics.cs` — static utility class. Forward kinematics using standard DH parameters, numerical Jacobian (3x6 linear, finite differences on FK), geometric angular Jacobian (3x6, joint z-axes). DLS pseudoinverse for both linear and angular velocity resolution. Manipulability measure for adaptive damping. `GetLinkPositions()` returns all 7 link origins (used for collision protection). `GetToolZAxis()` returns EE Z-axis direction (used for EE lock-down).
- `Assets/Scripts/SpatialMarkers.cs` — attach to robot root GameObject (must contain `tool0` in hierarchy). RGB axis cylinders on end-effector + yellow velocity arrow showing commanded Cartesian velocity direction/magnitude.
- `Assets/Scripts/RobotController.cs` — attach to any GameObject; uses **Unity Input System** (not OVRInput). Requires `RobotControlActions.inputactions` dragged into the Inspector's **Input Actions** field. Three control modes cycled via Menu button (RMRC → Direct Joint → Hand Guide → RMRC):
  - **RMRC mode** (default): Resolved Motion Rate Control with two sub-modes toggled by X button (left controller):
    - **Translate** (default): right stick = XY translation (forward/back, left/right), left stick Y = Z translation (up/down), left stick X = yaw. Uses 3x6 linear Jacobian.
    - **Rotate**: directly drives wrist joints — right stick Y = wrist_1 (pitch/tilt), right stick X = wrist_2 (roll), left stick X = wrist_3 (yaw/spin). Uses `jointJogSpeed` for responsive 1:1 control.
    - Both use `UR3eKinematics` DLS pseudoinverse. Adaptive damping near singularities. Proportional joint velocity scaling for safety. Publishes `Float64MultiArray` to `/forward_velocity_controller/commands`. No MoveIt needed.
  - **Direct Joint mode**: A/B to cycle joints, right stick Y for smooth proportional velocity control of selected joint. Publishes `Float64MultiArray` to `/forward_velocity_controller/commands`.
  - **Hand Guide mode**: Hold right grip trigger to engage — controller 3D position is tracked and mapped to end-effector position via proportional control + Jacobian IK. Release grip to stop (EE lock-down still applies if active). Requires `robotBase` field set to the `ur` GameObject in Inspector. Tunable `positionGain` (default 2) and `maxTrackingSpeed` (default 0.15 m/s). Joint bias weights (`[0.5, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]`) softly favour wrist movement over base/shoulder.
  - **Gripper**: Right index trigger (analog 0–1) controls gripper width. Dead zone (0.05) so resting finger = fully open. Smoothed, publishes `Float64MultiArray` (position in metres, 0=closed, 0.11=open) to `/finger_width_controller/commands` at 50Hz. Works in all modes simultaneously.
  - **EE Lock-Down**: Y button (left controller) toggles. When active, angular Jacobian drives tool Z-axis to [0,0,-1] (pointing straight down). Works immediately on toggle — no grip required. 2° dead zone prevents jitter when nearly aligned. Gain 1.5, max 1.0 rad/s, 2× damping on angular solve. Works in RMRC Translate and Hand Guide modes (including when grip is released).
  - **Collision Protection**: Delegated to `MeshCollisionGuard.cs`. Assign the guard in Inspector (`collisionGuard` field). Runs after all velocity computation, before publishing — scales or zeros `qDot` based on `collisionGuard.ComputeVelocityScale()`.
  - **Output Smoothing**: All joint velocities pass through an exponential low-pass filter (`outputSmoothTime` default 0.06s) before publishing. Prevents jitter in lock-down mode and smooths Hand Guide/RMRC output. Resets on mode switch to avoid sluggish transitions.
  - On Start, automatically disables conflicting XRI Default Input Actions (locomotion maps, Jump, Rotate Manipulation, UI Scroll) so thumbsticks and A/B buttons are not consumed by teleport/turn/move.
  - Publish rate: 50Hz.
- `Assets/Scripts/MeshCollisionGuard.cs` — attach to `ur3e_rg2` GameObject; set `robotBase` to itself. Auto-discovers all MeshColliders in robot hierarchy at Start, sets them convex for `ClosestPoint` queries. Groups colliders into proximal (base/shoulder/upper_arm) and distal (wrist through gripper). Table collision uses bounding box min Y vs table height. Self-collision uses `ClosestPoint` distance between proximal and distal groups. Both have soft-zone gradual slowdown + hard stop. Gizmo drawing in Scene view. `CollisionDebugVisualizer.cs` shows on-screen collision status label.
- `Assets/Scripts/RobotControlActions.inputactions` — Unity Input System action asset with bindings: LeftStick, RightStick, NextJoint (A), PrevJoint (B), ToggleMode (Menu). Deadzone handled via StickDeadzone processor.
- `Assets/Scripts/ROSAutoConnect.cs` — attach to any GameObject; auto-discovers `ros_tcp_endpoint` by TCP-scanning `192.168.0.101`–`109` on port 10000 (skips `.100` which is the Ethernet-to-robot interface). Sets `ConnectOnStart = false` in Awake, then scans from a background thread with 300ms connect timeout per IP. Retries up to 20 rounds (500ms between rounds). Falls back to Unity ROS Settings IP if nothing found. No beacon/multicast needed — works reliably on Quest/Android.
- `Assets/Scripts/HeadsetStreamPublisher.cs` — attach to an empty GameObject (e.g. `HeadsetStream`). Renders the Unity scene from the XR camera's perspective via a hidden secondary camera, JPEG-encodes it, and publishes `CompressedImage` to `/headset/image_compressed` at configurable FPS (default 15). Uses a skybox background so the dashboard sees the full scene.
- `Assets/Scripts/SessionLogger.cs` — attach to any GameObject; assign `RobotController` in Inspector (auto-finds via `FindObjectOfType` if not set). Publishes JSON session status to `/session/status` at 2Hz and discrete events to `/session/events`. On application quit, saves a JSON session log to `Application.persistentDataPath/SessionLogs/`.
- `Assets/Scripts/RobotHUD.cs` — attach to an empty GameObject; assign the `RobotController` reference in Inspector. Floating HUD panel tracks the camera with colour-coded mode title (amber=Joint, green=Translate, blue=Rotate, purple/red=Hand Guide), control hints for current mode, and readable joint names in Direct Joint mode.

## Dashboard (E-Stop & Debug Console)

- **Path:** `dashboard/`
- **Requirements:** PyQt5, rclpy (from ROS 2)
- **Target display:** Steam Deck OLED (1280x800) via Ubuntu desktop streaming from laptop (3456x2160 HiDPI)

### Running

```bash
# With ROS:
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && source ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
python3 dashboard/main.py --fullscreen

# Without ROS (UI testing):
python3 dashboard/main.py --no-ros --fullscreen

# Custom scale (default 2.5x in fullscreen for HiDPI→Steam Deck):
QT_SCALE_FACTOR=2.0 python3 dashboard/main.py --fullscreen
```

### Architecture

- `main.py` — PyQt5 GUI. Status bar (top), 6 tabbed screens (left), e-stop column (right, always visible). Polls ROS status at 30Hz. F11 toggles fullscreen. Left/Right arrow keys cycle tabs. Includes `RollingGraph` QPainter widget for real-time line charts.
- `ros_interface.py` — rclpy node (`holoassist_dashboard`). Independent of Unity/ros_tcp_endpoint — talks directly to ROS 2. Subscribes to `/session/status` and `/session/events` from Unity `SessionLogger`. Samples rolling data buffers: joint velocities (10Hz, 30s), topic health % (2Hz, 60s), latency metrics (10Hz, 30s). Saves dashboard-side session log to `~/holoassist_sessions/` on shutdown.

### E-Stop Behaviour

1. **Trigger:** Click the red EMERGENCY STOP button
2. **Immediate:** Burst-publishes `[0,0,0,0,0,0]` to `/forward_velocity_controller/commands` (10x), then continuous zeros at 50Hz
3. **Follow-up:** Deactivates `forward_velocity_controller` + `finger_width_controller` via `ros2 control switch_controllers`
4. **Resume:** Hold yellow RESUME button for 5 seconds → reactivates `forward_velocity_controller` + `finger_width_controller` + deactivates `scaled_joint_trajectory_controller`
5. **Cooldown:** 1-second cooldown after resume prevents accidental re-trigger

### Screens (tabs)

| Tab | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| STATUS | Working | Joint positions/velocities, event log |
| HEADSET | Working | Quest 3 XR scene view (JPEG stream from `HeadsetStreamPublisher.cs`) |
| CAMERA | Placeholder | Depth camera ROS topics (will show RealSense feed) |
| STATS | Working | Session info bar (duration, mode, switches, e-stops, mode %) + rolling joint velocity graph (6 coloured lines, 30s) + topic health graph (3 topics, 60s) |
| LATENCY | Working | Live latency numbers (colour-coded) + rolling message age graph (30s) + command interval graph (30s) |
| SESSION | Working | Text overview: control mode, sub-mode, hand guide state, mode durations, e-stop count, connection status, all topic rates |

## Known Issues

- **UR driver segfault (exit code -11)** — apt-installed `ros-humble-ur-robot-driver` crashes on Ubuntu 22.04. Now using `UR_OnRobot_ROS2` which builds the driver from source as a dependency.
- **Robot falls in Unity on Play** — no longer an issue. JointStateSubscriber.cs disables all ArticulationBody components (purely kinematic).
- **Git HTTPS clone fails on this machine** — always use SSH (`git@github.com:...`).
- **Unity Package Manager can't find robotics packages** — clone locally, reference via `file://` in `Packages/manifest.json`.
- **ros_tcp_endpoint crashes on Unity disconnect/reconnect** — known race condition in v0.7.0 (`InvalidHandle` exception). Restart the endpoint after every Unity Play/Stop cycle. Command must be on one line: `ros2 run ros_tcp_endpoint default_server_endpoint --ros-args -p ROS_IP:=0.0.0.0`
- **`/joint_states` not arriving in Unity despite subscription registering** — caused by duplicate message class registration. Delete `Assets/RosMessages/` entirely; types are built into ROS-TCP-Connector. (Fixed — RosMessages deleted.)
- **ROS joint names don't match Unity GameObject names** — Fixed with a `rosToUnity` mapping dictionary in JointStateSubscriber.cs.
- **Quest 3 networking** — laptop connects to robot via Ethernet (`192.168.0.100` ↔ `192.168.0.194`), Quest connects via WiFi. Set ROS IP in Unity to laptop's WiFi IP. Teach pendant External Control host IP = `192.168.0.100`.
- **OVRInput does nothing on Quest 3 (MR template)** — the Mixed Reality template uses Unity Input System + XR Interaction Toolkit, not OVR. Fixed by rewriting RobotController.cs to use `InputAction` with `<XRController>` bindings.
- **XRI Default Input Actions consume thumbsticks/buttons** — RobotController.cs disables conflicting action maps at runtime.
- **MoveIt Servo not used for teleoperation** — RMRC replaces it. MoveIt 2 will be used by Oliver's autonomous sorting subsystem.
- **forward_velocity_controller + finger_width_controller must be active** — RMRC and Direct Joint modes publish to `/forward_velocity_controller/commands`, gripper publishes to `/finger_width_controller/commands`. Switch controllers after launching the `ur_onrobot` driver.
- **RobotHUD may not render on Quest 3** — `Camera.main` can return null in the MR template, `Shader.Find` may return null on Android (shader stripping), runtime TextMeshPro needs an explicit font asset. Partially patched, functional enough.
- **URDF-Importer visual/collision STL name collision** — `LocateAssetHandler.cs:31` uses `Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension` to check `UsedTemplateFiles`, so if visual and collision meshes share the same filename (e.g., both `base_link.stl`), the visual prefab creation is skipped. Fixed by renaming visual STLs to `*_visual.stl`.
